We have demonstrated this commitment through action, investing significant resources to ensure that all our launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites meet or exceed space safety and sustainability regulations, as well as sharing best practices with other launch providers and satellite operators around the world.</p><p>Starlink satellites operate in a low Earth orbit below 600 km altitude. Atmospheric drag at these altitudes will deorbit a satellite naturally in 5 years or less, depending on the altitude and satellite design, should one fail on orbit. SpaceX proactively deorbits satellites that are identified to be at an elevated risk of becoming non-maneuverable. This proactive approach minimizes the number of non-maneuverable satellites in space. Starlink satellites are also fully demisable by design, meaning that the risk to those on the ground, in the air, or at sea from a deorbiting satellite is effectively zero as the satellites burn up during reentry.</p><button class="btn text-white" type="button" style="text-align: start;align-items: start;padding: 0;">Read More ...</button></div></div><div></div></div><div style="color: white;background-attachment: fixed;background-color: black;padding-bottom: 10%;"><div class="border rounded overflow-hidden" style="padding: 4% 4% 0;"><div class="row g-0"><div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-xxl-5 offset-xl-0 offset-xxl-0"><div class="text-white p-4 p-md-4"><h2 class="fw-bold text-white mb-3">SPACEX SENDS FIRST TEXT MESSAGES VIA ITS NEWLY LAUNCHED DIRECT TO CELL SATELLITES</h2><p class="mb-4">JAN 10, 2024</p><p class="mb-4">On Monday, January 8, the Starlink team successfully sent and received our first text messages using T-Mobile network spectrum through one of our new Direct to Cell satellites launched six days prior. Connecting cell phones to satellites has several major challenges to overcome. For example, in terrestrial networks cell towers are stationary, but in a satellite network they move at tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to users on Earth. This requires seamless handoffs between satellites and accommodations for factors like Doppler shift and timing delays that challenge phone to space communications. Cell phones are also incredibly difficult to connect to satellites hundreds of kilometers away given a mobile phone’s low antenna gain and transmit power. Starlink satellites with the Direct to Cell payload are equipped with innovative new custom silicon, phased array antennas, and advanced software algorithms that overcome these challenges and provide standard LTE service to cell phones on the ground. As the global leader in rocket and satellite launch and manufacturing, SpaceX is uniquely positioned to rapidly scale our Direct to Cell network and will rapidly launch a constellation of hundreds of satellites to enable text service in 2024 and voice, data, and Internet of Things (IoT) services in 2025.</p><button class="btn text-white" type="button" style="text-align: start;align-items: start;padding: 0;">Read More ...</button></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-xl-6 offset-xl-0 order-first order-md-last"><img src="/assets/img/updates_blog9_d.webp?h=d76e8901a0091a5fc71da609442d5ce7" style="width: 100%;height: auto;display: block;object-fit: cover;"></div></div></div></div><div class="row gy-4 gy-md-0 text-white" style="padding: 4%;background-color: black;"><div class="col-md-6"><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="/assets/img/updates_blog8_d.webp?h=d76e8901a0091a5fc71da609442d5ce7" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;"></div><div class="col-md-5 col-xxl-5 offset-xxl-0 d-md-flex" style="margin-left: 5%;"><div><h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">SECOND GENERATION STARLINK SATELLITES</h2><p>FEB 26, 2023</p><p>Since the original license to operate the Starlink Generation 1 network was granted in March 2018, SpaceX has rapidly deployed satellites to bring internet to the hardest to reach places in the United States and abroad.
